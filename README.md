# codethechange

A simple MVC Java Swing app that we made at an 8-hour Code the Change hackathon. The app uses a MVC architecture pattern and 'tracks' a user's transportation/commute CO2 emissions options over time. The idea is that a competition would be kicked off within a group, and people would essentially compare their CO2 impact throughout that period. This would allow someone to get a better feel for their actual CO2 contributions and to get ideas for how to decrease their personal impact.

This was early in our university program, and our front-end experience was quite lacking. It was a lot of fun to work with a group to create something in a short timeline, though!
