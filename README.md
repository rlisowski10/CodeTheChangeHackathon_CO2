# codethechange

A simple MVC Java Swing app that we made at a Code the Change hackathon. The app uses a MVC architecture pattern, and 'tracks' a user's CO2 emissions using different transportation options over time. The idea is that a competition would be kicked off with a group and people would essentially compare their CO2 impact over time. This would allow people to get a better feel for their actual CO2 contributions and to get ideas for how to decrease their personal impact.

This was early in our university program, and our front-end experience was very lacking. It was a lot of fun to work with a group to create something in a short timeline, though!
